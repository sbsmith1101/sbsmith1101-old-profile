                        <p>the old wind in the willows book was something my dad grew up with and the one toy which survived his childhood was a Thomas the toad doll. He gave it to me and my brothers, I don't know what he was thinking when he did that but suffice to say that Thomas didn't survive a 2nd tour of childhood.  </p>
                        <p>Thinking about a project one day my family member meantioned that old toy, and thus this model took form. </p>

                        <p>I might take the same idea and recreate it in the future.</p>
